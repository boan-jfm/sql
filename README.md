This library implements (yet another) database abstraction and (yet another) query builder.

It is:

  * Query-builders for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `SELECT` queries, with a chainable API.
  * Schema abstraction with two-way support for conversion between PHP data-types/objects and relational data.
  * An abstraction over PDO adding support for `array` values with PDO-style `:name` placeholders.
  * Streaming iteration of query results enabling you to process results in arbitrary-size batches.
  * On-fly-fly mapping of functions against individual records, or batches of records.
  * **NOT** an object/relational-mapper.

An important non-goal of this project is the ability to switch from one database technology to another -
while we do support both MySQL and PostgreSQL, and while a lot of the implementations are shared, no attempt
is made at hiding or abstracting the differences between each technology. On the contrary, we try to make it
plain and obvious that there are differences, both in terms of capabilities and best patterns for each DBMS.

We favor simplicity over ease of use - this library minimally abstracts PDO and stays reasonably close to SQL
and the relational model, rather than attempting to hide it.

### Project Status

Per [SimVersion](https://simversion.github.io/), the `0.x` release series is *feature-incomplete*, *not* "unstable",
and will not transition to `1.x` until it is feature-complete.

The project has been widely used on many internal projects in our organization - it is "stable", but is still
subject to changes, and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

The public API has been largely stable for many releases - at this point, most breaking changes are changes to
the internal `protected` portion of the API; typically, a major `0.x+1` release has very little impact on client code.

### Contributions

Current target is php 5.5 and later, see `.travis.yml`.

Code adheres to [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

To run the test-suite:

    php test/test.php

To run only the unit or integration suites:

## Quick Start

Every project needs a `Schema` class and one `Table` class for every table in that schema.

This boostrapping process may seem a little verbose, but with IDE support, you will write these simple
classes in no-time - these classes in turn will provide support for static analysis tools and IDEs,
e.g. with auto-completion for table/column names, making your database work simple and safe.

It's worth it.

#### 1. Create Table Models

Define your table model by extending the `Table` class.

Your table classes act as factories for `Column` objects.

Add one method per column, each returning a `Column` object - the `Table` class provides several different
protected factory-methods to help with the creation of `Column` instances.

The method-name should match the column name.

You should add a `@property-read` annotation for each column for optimal static analysis.

The table model pattern looks like this:

```php
/**
 * @property-read Column $id
 * @property-read Column $first_name
 * @property-read Column $last_name
 */
class UserTable extends Table
{
    public function id($alias)
    {
        return $this->autoColumn(__FUNCTION__, IntType::class, $alias);
    }
    
    public function first_name($alias)
    {
        return $this->requiredColumn(__FUNCTION__, StringType::class, $alias);
    }

    public function last_name($alias)
    {
        return $this->requiredColumn(__FUNCTION__, StringType::class, $alias);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Create Schema Model

Define your schema model by extending the `Schema` class.

Your schema class acts as a factory for `Table` objects.

Add one method per `Table` type, each returning a `Table` object - the `Schema` class provides a
protected factory-method `createTable()` to help with the creation of `Table` instances.

The method-name should match the table-name.

You should add a `@property-read` annotation for each table for optimal static analysis.

The schema model pattern looks like this:

```php
/**
 * @property-read UserTable    $user
 * @property-read AddressTable $address
 */
class UserSchema extends Schema
{
    /**
     * @param string $alias
     * 
     * @return UserTable
     */
    public function user($alias)
    {
        return $this->createTable(UserTable::class, __FUNCTION__, $alias);
    }

    /**
     * @param string $alias
     * 
     * @return AddressTable
     */
    public function address($alias)
    {
        return $this->createTable(AddressTable::class, __FUNCTION__, $alias);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Bootstrap Your Project

If you use a dependency injection container, you should perform this bootstrapping once and register
these objects as services in your container.

First, select a `Database` implementation - for example:

```php
$db = new MySQLDatabase();
```

Next, create (and register in your DI container) your `Schema` model:

```php
/** @var UserSchema $schema */
$schema = $db->getSchema(UserSchema::class);
```

Finally, create (and register) a matching `Connection` implementation - for example:

```php
$connection = $db->createConnection(new PDO("mysql:dbname=foo;host=127.0.0.1", "root", "root"));
```

Don't quibble about the fact that you need three different dependencies - it may seem complicated
or verbose, but it's actually very simple; each of these three components have a very distinct
purpose and scope:

  * The `Database` model acts as a factory for `Schema` types and various query-types (insert, select, etc.)
  
  * Your `Schema`-type acts as a factory-class for your domain-specific `Table`-types.
  
  * The `Connection` object provides a thin wrapper over `PDO`, which doesn't have an interface of it's own.

Note that the `Database` model and `Schema`-types have *no dependency* on the `Connection` object - the
database model and query-builders operate entirely in the abstract with no dependency on any physical
database connection, which is great, as it enables you to write (and unit-test) complex query-builders
independently of any database connection.

#### 4. Create Queries

Creating a query begins with the `Database` model and your `Schema`-type:

```php
$user = $schema->user;

$query = $db->select($user)
    ->where("{$user->first_name} LIKE :name")
    ->bind("name", "%rasmus%")
    ->order("{$user->last_name} DESC, {$user->first_name} DESC")
    ->page(1, 20); // page 1, 20 records per page, e.g.: OFFSET 0 LIMIT 20
```

Note the use of `__toString()` magic, which is supported by `Table`-types and `Column` objects.

You're now ready to `fetch()` from the `Connection` and iterate over the results:

```php
$result = $connection->fetch($query);

foreach ($result as $record) {
    // ...
}
```

To learn how to build nested queries, joins and other query-types, refer to inline documentation
in the codebase, and peep at the [unit tests](test/test.php).

## Logging

Logging of queries is supported via the [`Logger`](src/framework/Logger.php) interface - and instance
can be injected into a `Connection` instance with the `addLogger()` method.

A [`BufferedPSRLogger`](src/framework/BufferedPSRLogger) implementation is available - this will buffer
executed queries, until you choose to flush them to a [PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) logger,
for example:

```php
$buffer = new BufferedPSRLogger();

$connection->addLogger($buffer);

// ... execute queries ...

$buffer->flushTo($psr_logger);
```

Where `$psr_logger` is a `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` implementation of your choosing.

You may want to check out [`kodus/chrome-logger`](https://github.com/kodus/chrome-logger), which can be
used to render an SQL query-log via [ChromeLogger](https://craig.is/writing/chrome-logger) in tabular format.

## Concepts

The concepts used in this library can be roughly divided into two main areas: the framework and the model.

The codebase is namespaced accordingly.

### Framework

The framework consists of database Connection, Statement and Prepared Statement abstractions, and an
implementation of these for PDO.

In addition, the framework includes an iterable Result model which includes support for a Mapper abstraction
and implementations providing support for custom operations on individual records, as well as processing of
results in batches of multiple records.

### Model

The model includes a Driver abstraction, Query Builders for `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and custom
SQL queries, a Schema model and a Type abstraction, which includes a Mapper implementation for Type conversions.

## Performance

Plenty fast.

A simple [benchmark](test/benchmark.php) of query-builder performance is included - a simple `SELECT` with
`ORDER` and `LIMIT` clauses builds in ~0.1 msec, and a more complex `SELECT` with two `JOIN` clauses and a
bunch of conditions and parameters builds in ~0.5 msec. (on my Windows 10 laptop running PHP 7)

## Architecture

This section contains notes for inquisitive minds.

The overall architecture consists of high-level `Query` models and a low-level `PreparedStatement` abstraction.

At the `Query` layer, values are managed as native PHP values. Simple values, such as `int`, `float`, `string`,
`bool`, `null`, are internally managed, and the use of arrays is managed by expanding PDO-style placeholders.

The `Query` models implement either `Executable` or `ReturningExecutable`, depending on whether the type of
query returns records (`SELECT`, `INSERT..RETURNING`, etc.) or not. (`INSERT`, `DELETE`, etc.)

The `Connection` abstraction prepares a `Statement` and generates a `PreparedStatement` instance - at this
layer, the abstraction is connection-dependent, and only scalar values are supported.

The idea of internally managing the creation of the `PDOStatement` instance was considered, but this would block
the consumer from making potential optimizations by repeatedly executing the same prepared statement. By hiding
the creation of `PDOStatement` from the consumer (e.g. by implicitly preparing the statement again if a non-scalar
type is used) the performance implications would have been hidden - in other words, the `PreparedStatement` model,
with it's inability to bind anything other than scalar values, accurately reflects the real-world limitations
and performance implications of prepared statements in PDO.
